            Christian Varisco
        </h1>
        <p>I am a Software Developer and my aim is to learn everything about web and app development. I have a particular passion
            to write clean code and I always put all my effort to achieve the most clean, user friendly and well designed
            user interface.
            <br>If I don't know the answer to a question, I'll be honest and tell you that I'm not able to answer, but I will
            also do my best to get that answer as soon and as efficiently as possible.
