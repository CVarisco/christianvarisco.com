        <p id="description">My name is Christan Varisco, I am a Front end Developer and my aim is to learn everything about web design and app
            development. I have a particular passion to write clean code and I always put all my effort to achieve the most
            clean, user friendly and well designed user interface.If I don't know the answer to a question, I'll be honest
            and tell you that I'm not able to answer, but I will also do my best to get that answer as soon and as efficiently
            as possible.</p>
