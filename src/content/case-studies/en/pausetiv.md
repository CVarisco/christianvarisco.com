## The Company

Pausetiv is an early-stage HealthTech platform that helps women discover and navigate menopause with a structured medical approach. It connects patients and healthcare professionals through a real clinical tool, with dual B2B (doctors) and B2C (patients) targets.

## The Challenge

The main challenge was building a serious medical tool with limited startup budget and aggressive timelines. Since it dealt with health and required trust from healthcare professionals, it couldn't look like a hastily assembled prototype.

The team had to:
- **Maintain a polished interface** from day one
- **Implement core functionality** without compromising quality
- **Track metrics** to validate every feature

## Our Approach

### Team Assembly

I assembled a freelance team of three specialists from my network:
- **Full-stack developer** for technical implementation
- **Product manager** for backlog management and priorities
- **Designer** to ensure a professional interface

### Methodology

- **Agile weekly sprints** with constant alignment
- **Backlog refinement** based on user feedback and metrics
- Cardinal rule: **"no feature without justification"**

## The Results

### Time-to-Market

**Launch in 4 months** from zero code to live platform.

### Perceived Quality

Positive feedback on interface and user experience. **"No one said 'it looks like a prototype'"** - the platform was perceived as professional from day one.

### Business Validation

**First B2B partnerships** with companies for welfare benefits, demonstrating the validity of the business model.
