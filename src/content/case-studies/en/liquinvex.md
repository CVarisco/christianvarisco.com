## The Company

Liquinvex is a premium wine marketplace where users can buy rare bottles, invest in wine, and sell through the platform. The target is investors who want to diversify their investment portfolios with positions in fine wines.

## The Challenge

Paradoxically, Liquinvex had a working application with active iOS users and concrete requests from Android users, but couldn't publish on the app store.

A previous failed collaboration had left the two founders (lacking technical skills) stuck with a product almost ready to launch. After two months of stagnation, investors were waiting and customers were asking for the Android version.

## Our Approach

### Immediate Unblock

I proposed an immediate unblock: **free development for the first week**, then evaluation of the collaboration. This allowed us to build trust and demonstrate value quickly.

### Team Assembly

I coordinated four trusted freelance professionals:
- **Backend developer**
- **Frontend developer**
- **Product manager**
- **Designer**

### Methodology

- **MoSCoW methodology** with Kanban board for effective prioritization
- **Tech stack**: React Native (mobile), Laravel (backend), PostgreSQL (database)
- **Focus on rapid execution** rather than technical perfection

## The Results

### Quick Unblock

From stuck to **live in 1 week** - a turnaround that unblocked the entire company.

### Fundraising

Raised **€110,000** 6 months after resuming development.

### Recognition

**Admission to Nana Bianca** (one of Italy's most competitive accelerators) after 6 months.

### Lasting Partnership

**2 years of stable collaboration**, during which we implemented: revised purchase system, accelerated redemption for premium bottles, complete marketplace with sales functionality.
