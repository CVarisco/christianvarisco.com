## The Company

Lexroom is a platform that uses artificial intelligence to revolutionize legal research. The system analyzes documents, finds relevant precedents, and generates precise answers in real-time for law firms and legal professionals.

## The Challenge

The startup had solid technical skills but lacked strategic focus. Developers were creating features without clear direction and risked wasting limited resources. The team wanted "someone to help us figure out what to really focus on."

## Our Approach

I introduced a series of structural changes to give the team direction:

### Methodology and Process

- **Structured Kanban methodology** with weekly backlog refinement
- **Prioritization based on business impact vs technical effort**
- **Clear sprints** with measurable objectives

### Strategic Decisions

Strategic decision to postpone backend refactoring to focus on customer-requested features. This allowed the team to maintain focus on what generated immediate value.

### Team Building

Recruited developers and product designers as freelancers from my network to accelerate development without burdening the structure.

## The Results

The partnership produced extraordinary results:

### Funding Growth

From **€500K pre-seed** to **€16M seed round** in less than 2 years. Growth that demonstrates the solidity of the technical foundations and the product.

### Team Scaling

The team grew from **3 to 15 people**, maintaining quality and company culture.

### Operational Autonomy

After 6 months, the team achieved **complete operational autonomy**, a sign of well-structured processes and effective knowledge transfer.
