## The Company

Talentware is a startup that helps large companies manage talent with an AI skill-based approach. They map employees' real competencies and use AI to suggest career paths, development plans, and automatic successions. Target: Enterprises that want to retain talent and optimize performance.

## The Challenge

Three brilliant co-founders with an MVP on no-code tools were looking for someone who could "build enterprise-ready infrastructure from day zero" and manage growing technical teams, navigating the complexities of B2B enterprise without the typical startup mistakes.

## Our Approach

I adopted a **smart compromise**: moderate speed + enterprise quality from day one.

### Architectural Strategy

- **Think about ISO 27001 certification from day zero** - not as an afterthought
- **Set up single-tenant architecture** for enterprise clients
- **Infrastructure as Code from the first commit** - solid foundations from the start

### Team Building

Hybrid approach: external developers for initial speed + structured recruitment to build the internal team over time.

## The Results

### Team Scaling

From 3 founders + Fractional CTO to a **tech team of 15 people** in less than 2 years.

### Fundraising

**€1.2M pre-seed round** thanks to solid technical foundations and an enterprise-ready product.

### Accelerated Certification

**ISO 27001 in 4 months** (vs standard 12-24 months) - possible thanks to early planning.

### Successful Transition

Transition to **internal CTO completed with zero interruptions**. Team 80% autonomous, a sign of effective processes and documentation.
