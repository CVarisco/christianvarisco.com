## Frequently Asked Questions

### What services does Christian offer to startups?
I solve problems in three key areas: Product, Tech, and Team. For Product, I help you define which features need to be developed and when. For Tech, I lead on what technology to use, how to implement it, and when to roll it out. For Team, I assist in finding and leading the best people to work in your startup, whether they are freelancers or part of an internally hired team.

### How many startups do you work with in parallel?
I work with a maximum of three startups in parallel. This allows me to focus on delivering quality results for each project.

### Do you write code too?
If needed, yes. However, my primary goal is to leverage my experience to guide you on how to build a successful startup, rather than just writing software.

### Do you have a team?
Yes, I have a network of collaborators that includes developers, designers, product managers, and various other professionals. They can step in to assist both me and your startup whenever necessary.

### What stage startups do you typically work with?
I typically work with early-stage startups that have at least a $20k budget to invest in technology (not for me, but for the rest of the team). These startups may or may not have a CTO to collaborate with, and they can either have an internal team or rely on my network of professionals.

### What is the typical duration of your engagements with startups?
Generally, my engagements last between 3 to 9 months to ensure we build a solid foundation in terms of product, technology, and team. However, if needed, I can also provide advisory services for as little as one hour a week, with engagements lasting just one month.

### How do you handle confidentiality and data security?
Before we start working together, it's up to you. I can sign an NDA and term sheet if needed (and if they make sense) to ensure your confidentiality and data security.
